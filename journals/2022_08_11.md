- This is a simple graph designed to reproduce an issue I've been having with a query to keep track of books I've been reading.   It consists of only 3 pages
	- Templates.md - defines the template for a book
	- book.md - defines the queries to keep track of the books
	- The Night Circus.md - a page with a populated book template that seems to cause problems with the queries.
- Well nuts, after setting up this graph, the [[books]] page seems to render just fine.  Was NOT able to reproduce the problem.
- I've now copied ALL of my book template files.  There are 33 of them.   It appears this is the magic number that causes logseq to hang.
	- Before returning to the books query page I am removing one book and re-indexing.   Even after doing this I still hung.
- Trying an experiment where I change the `type:: #book` to `type:: book` to remove all the backlink references on the page with the queries
