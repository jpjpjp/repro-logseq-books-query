- This graph can be used to reproduce and error where a query of books on the [[books-read-query]] page can crash logseq if enough book pages are present in the graph.
	- Key elements in the graph include:
		- [[Templates]] - defines the template for a book
		- [[books]] - defines the queries to keep track of the books.  It includes references to queries defined on the following pages:
			- [[books-reading-query]]
			- [[books-to-read-query]]
			- [[books-read-query]] - this query generally returns the most results.
	- As of today the graph contains 20 books.  When the query is run the process Logseq Helper (Renderer) grows to >2G.   Adding more books increases the size of this process and in general about 30 books will cause it to grow > 3.5G and eventually crash.
		- [[The Lifters]] is an example of a page with a book that has been read.
