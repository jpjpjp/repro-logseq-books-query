- This is a template for my daily journal to try to force work on the things I want to work on.  I'm starting with the keyword `#habit` in the hopes that I can eventually look into using [Logseq Habit Tracker](https://github.com/c6p/logseq-habit-tracker)

- My goal is to use this page for all templates, but this query should find any other stragglers:
	- This query did NOT Filter out templates from this page: ``{{query (and (property template) (not (property title Templates))) }}``
	- This query shows templates defined anywhere else in the graph:
	  #+BEGIN_QUERY
	  {
	   :query [:find (pull ?b [*])
	           :where
	           [?b :block/properties ?prop]
	           [(get ?prop :template) ?t]
	           (not [?b :block/page [:block/name "templates"]] )
	      ]
	      :collapsed? true
	  }
	  #+END_QUERY
